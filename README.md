# ElectroMagnetic-Shielding-with-Matlab
In this project, a shielded room was designed such that high frequency waves cannot penetrate
into the room. In order to achieve this outcome, the nonmagnetic, non-conducting shield is
coated with a conducting material that should reduce the electromagnetic wave by a factor of
10 6 compared to the field outside. The conducting layer may be made of copper, aluminum,
mu-metal, or a conducting polymer (Inconel-Alloy 625) based on different priorities. The elec-
tromagnetic properties for each of these four materials were found in order to calculate the
thickness required for each of them depending on the angle of incidence and polarization of the
wave. Then the corresponding cost and density for each of these materials was found. Based
on these characteristics (mass, volume, and cost), the materials are compared and the optimal
material was selected. The mathamatical modeling for this project was done using MatLab.
